#Alvin's Notes

## Summary

This repository contains all of the notes taken by [Alvin](https://github.com/alvinoalvin/lighthouse_compass) for the Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp.

## Day 1 (Markdown, and Getting Started)

### Markdown syntax

[Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code)

## Day 2 (Functions)

### 5 rules of js functions:

1.  Give your functions precise verb/action based names
2.  Use camelCasedNames (like this one)
3.  Properly indent the function code
4.  Functions should focus on a single task: returning a value or causing a side effect. Break your function into additional smaller functions if you find it doing two or more things
5.  One single task could be to compute and return a value (eg: zeroPad)
6.  Another single task could be to perform a side effect such as logging a message to the screen (eg: printFarmInventory)
7.  Data needed by Functions should be passed in as parameters/arguments (i.e. local scope) instead of being accessed directly

## Day 3 (Objects)

No Notes

## Day 4(Functions)

can use function attributes as vars function

```
let blah = function(){
console.log("blah")
};

blah.bleh = "bloop"
```

a callback function is a function to be invoked by another function.

Arrow function
`const name = (param) => {//do something};`

single line arrow functions automatically return value

`const addTwo = num => num + 2;//automatically returns num + 2`
